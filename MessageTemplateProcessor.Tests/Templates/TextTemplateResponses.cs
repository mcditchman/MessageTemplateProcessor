My name is John Doe, and I’m part of the Hiring Team here at Scorpion, a 1,200-person, pre-IPO marketing software company.

I'm impressed, Cole! 5 years at a place is not common amongst Engineers. Allscripts must treat you well :)

I see that you're open to work, and I'm wondering if you'd be interested in the following role with us: https://www.getscorpion.com/careers/job/?jobid=630

This is a fully-remote, full-time role with us. We're offering a salary range of $130K - $170K/yr. DOE, unlimited PTO, 100% paid medical benefits for you, stock options, and more that I can go over.

If this role interests you, would you be open to a phone interview with me?

Cheers,

John Doe
